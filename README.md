AeroPy is a way for users to control their computers through hand gestures. 



USAGE

RIGHT HAND
   CURSOR
    At any given moment that your right hand is in view of your webcam, your index finger controls your cursor. Move 
    your hand and your cursor moves accordingly. 
    
   LEFT AND RIGHT CLICK
    Pinch your middle finger and thumb together to left click and your pinky and thumb together to right click. 
    
   SPEAK TO TYPE
    Pinch your ring finger and thumb together and then speak (you must have an audio input source). Once you are done speaking 
    what you have said will be typed out where your cursor is placed. 

   SWITCH TABS
    swipe right with your right hand as far right as possible until your tab switches


LEFT HAND
  VOLUME CONTROL
  At any given frame where your left hand is in view of your webcam the distance between your left hand index finger and 
  your left hand thumb represents how high or low the volume of your computer is.
